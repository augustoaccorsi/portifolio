                <p>Hi there! Iâ€™m Augusto Accorsi, but my friends call me Guto. Having worked in software development for almost 10 years,
                I have tried quite a few areas before discovering the developer I want to be is a frontend engineer or a full-stack developer.
                Everything started with HTML and CSS of course, that software coding was a brave new world for me. After that, I found myself with ABAP, trying to navigate in the sea of enterprise software.
                Nonetheless, I realized that my real passion was frontend development, which means dealing with JavaScript and, later, Node.js. Since then, I have acquired rich experience in developing user interfaces from scratch, starting from responsive layouts to performance understanding.
                </p>
